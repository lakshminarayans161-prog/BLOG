# Basic CRUD Application (PHP & MySQL)
# CRUD Application with Advanced Features (Task-3)

A simple blog-style CRUD app with user authentication (registration/login) built with PHP (mysqli) and MySQL.
Enhanced CRUD app with:
- Search functionality for posts
- Pagination (5 posts per page)
- UI improvements using Bootstrap 5

## Features
- Register and Login (password hashing with `password_hash`).
- Create, Read, Update, Delete posts.
- Session-based authentication guard.

## Requirements
- PHP 8+
- MySQL / MariaDB
- Apache (XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP or similar)
- Git (optional)
- User authentication (register/login)
- Create, Read, Update, Delete posts
- Search and pagination on posts
- Responsive UI with Bootstrap

## Setup
1. Create database and tables:
   - Import `database.sql` into your MySQL server.

2. Configure DB connection:
   - Edit `config.php` if your MySQL credentials differ.

3. Run locally:
   - Place the folder in your web root (e.g., `C:/xampp/htdocs/blog`).
   - Start Apache and MySQL.
   - Visit `http://localhost/blog/register.php` to create a user, then login.

## Pages
- `register.php` — create a user
- `login.php` — login
- `index.php` — list posts (protected)
- `create.php` — create post (protected)
- `edit.php` — update post (protected)
- `delete.php` — delete post (protected, POST only)
- `logout.php` — end session

## Notes
- All queries use prepared statements.
- Passwords are hashed; never store plaintext passwords.
1. Import `database.sql` into MySQL (same schema as Task-2).
2. Adjust `config.php` if needed.
3. Place folder in web root (e.g. `htdocs`).
4. Run `http://localhost/crud_app_task3/`.
